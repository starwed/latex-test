The gyromagnetic ratio of bound particles is an active area of experimental and theoretical research.  In particular theoretical results applicable to hydrogen-like bound states are useful.  Here we derive leading order binding order corrections for particles of arbitrary spin, by constructing an effective nonrelativistic Lagrangian.  

First Lagrangians for spin one-half and spin one-theories are developed, before moving on to the more general case of arbitrary spin.  In each case, an effective nonrelativistic Lagrangian taking into account all relevant terms is constructed.  The coefficients of this Lagrangian are then fixed by calculating scattering processes in both the relativistic and nonrelativistic theories.  

A relativistic framework for dealing with particles of arbitrary spin is considered.  In this framework the relevant terms in the scattering process are heavily constrained by the symmetries required of the electromagnetic current.  This allows the determination of an effective Lagrangian valid for arbitrary spin.  It is found that the only coefficients which depend upon the spin of the particle in question involve derivatives of the magnetic field.  The specific results for spin one-half and spin one are consistent with earlier results. 

With this nonrelativistic Lagrangian, the bound gyromagnetic ratio is calculated.  The result is found to be universal, independent of the spin of the particles involved.
