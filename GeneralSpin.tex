\subsection{Formalism}
First we need to work out a formalism that will apply to the general spin case.  
We want to represent the spin state of the particles by an object that looks like a generalization of the Dirac bispinor.

%TODO check what to call helical basis
It is easiest to start with the Dirac basis, where the upper and lower components of the bispinor are objects of opposite helicity, each transforming as an object of spin $1/2$.

To that end define an object

\[
\Psi  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \xi \\ \eta \end{pmatrix}
\]

that we wish to have the appropriate properties.  Each component should transform as a particle of spin s, but with opposite helicity.  Under reflection the upper and lower components transform into each other.

The irreducible representations of the proper Lorentz group are spinors which are seperately symmetric in dotted and undotted indices.  The spin of the particle will be half the total number of indices.  So if $\xi$ is an object with $p$ undotted and $q$ dotted indices
\[
	\xi = \{ \xi^{\alpha_1 \ldots \alpha_p}_{\dot\beta_1 \ldots \dot\beta_q} \}
\]
Then this is a represenation of a particle of spin $s = (p+q)/2$.

We have some free choice in how to partition the dotted/undotted indices, and we cannot choose exactly the same scheme for all spin as long as both types of indices are present.  However, we can make separately consistent choices for integral and half-integral spin.  For integral spin we can say $p=q=s$, while for the half-integral case we'll choose $p=s+\frac{1}{2}$, $q=s-\frac{1}{2}$.




We want the $\xi$ and $\eta$ to transform as objects of opposite helicity.  Under reflection they will transform into each other.  So 
 \[
	\eta = \{ \eta_{\dot \alpha_1 \ldots \dot \alpha_p}^{\beta_1 \ldots \beta_q} \}
\] 




In the rest frame of the particle, they will have clearly defined and identical properties under rotation.    The rest frame spinors are equivalent to rank $2s$ nonrelativistic spinors.  So the bispinor in the rest frame looks like
\[
\Psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \xi_0 \\ \xi_0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

where
\[
	\xi_0 = \{ (\xi_0)_{\alpha_1 \ldots \alpha_p \beta_1 \ldots \beta_q}  \}
\]
and all indices are symmetric.

We can obtain the spinors in an arbitrary frame by boosting from the rest frame.  The upper and lower components we have defined to have opposite helicity, and so will act in opposite ways under boost:
\[
	\xi = \exp{(\frac{\v{\Sigma} \cdot \v{\rapidity}}{2}) } \xi_0,  
	\hspace{3em} 
	\eta = \exp{(-\frac{\v{\Sigma} \cdot \v{\rapidity}}{2}) } \xi_0
\]

%TODO check dotted/undotted transformations are correct
What form should the operator $\v{\Sigma}$ have?  Under an infitesimal boost by a rapidity $\phi$, a spinor with a single undotted index is transformed as
\[
	\xi_\alpha \to \xi'_\alpha = \left(\delta_{\alpha \beta} + \frac{\gv{\rapidity}\cdot \gv{\sigma}_{\alpha \beta} }{2} \right) \xi_\beta 
\]
while one with a dotted index will transform as
\[
\xi_{\dot\alpha} \to \xi'_{\dot\alpha} = \left(\delta_{\dot \alpha \dot \beta} - \frac{\gv{\rapidity}\cdot \gv{\sigma}_{\dot \alpha \dot\beta} }{2} \right) \xi_{\dot \beta}
\]


The infinitesmal transformation of a higher spin object with the first $p$ indices undotted and the last $q$ dotted would then be
\[
	\xi \to \xi' = \left(1 
		+  \sum\limits_{a=0}^p \frac{\gv{\sigma}_a \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2}
		- \sum\limits_{a=p+1}^{p+q} \frac{\gv{\sigma}_a \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2}
	\right ) \xi 
\]
where $a$ denotes which spinor index of $\xi$ is operated on.


If we define 
\[
	\v{\Sigma} = \sum\limits_{a=0}^p \gv{\sigma}_a - \sum\limits_{a=p+1}^{p+q} \gv{\sigma}_a 
\]

Then the infinitesmal transformations would be
\[
	\xi \to \xi' = \left( 1 + \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right) \xi
\]
\[
	\eta \to \eta' = \left( 1 - \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right) \eta
\]
So the exact transformation should be
\[
		\xi \to \xi' = \exp\left( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right) \xi
\]
\[
	\eta \to \eta' = \exp \left( -\frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right) \eta
\]  
  
Therefore, the bispinor of some particle boosted by $\gv{phi}$ will be
% TODO check passive v. active boost
\[
\Psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 
		\exp\left( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right)\xi_0 \\ 
		\exp \left( \frac{-\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right) \xi_0 
	\end{pmatrix}
\]


In dealing with the relativistic theory, we'll want a basis that seperates the particle and antiparticle parts of the wave function.  If we want the upper component to be the particle, then in the rest frame the lower component will vanish, and for low momentum will be small compared to the upper component.  The unitary transformation which accomplishes this is

\[
	\Psi' = \begin{pmatrix} \phi \\ \chi \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
	\phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\xi + \eta)
\]
\[
	\chi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( \eta - \xi)
\]

Which is equivalent to
\[
	\Psi' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \Psi
\]

Then,
\[
	\phi =  \cosh \left( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right ) \xi_0
\]

%Sign confusion compared to original equation again
\[
	\chi =  \sinh \left( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2} \right ) \xi_0
\]

\subsection{Electromagnetic Interaction}
%TODO insert diagram, showing the type of interaction we're talking about, defining momenta of particles in question.
Knowing how the wave functions themselves behave, we want to see what that tells us about possible electromagnetic interaction.  Interaction with a single electromagnetic photon should take the form

\[
	M = A_\mu j^\mu 
\]
where $j^\mu$ is the electromagnetic current.


The electromagnetic current must be built out of the particle's momenta and bilinears of the charged particle fields in such a way that they have the correct Lorentz properties.  We must also demand current conservation: the equation $q_\mu j^\mu = 0$ must hold.  Above we already have shown that, in the case of general spin, there exist only two such bilinears, a scalar and a tensor.

There will be two permissible terms in the current.  We could consider a scalar bilinear coupled with a single power of external momenta.  In order to fufill the current conservation requirement, it should be
\[
	\frac{p^\mu + p'^\mu}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger \Psi
\]
This will obey current conservation because $q = p' -p$, and $ (p+p')\cdot(p'-p) = p^2-p'^2=0$

We can also consider a tensor term contracted with a power of momenta.  To fufill current conservation, we can demand that the tensor bilinear be antisymmetric, and contract it with $q$:
\[
	\frac{q_\nu}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger T^{\mu\nu} \Psi
\]

We don't need to worry about higher order tensor bilinears: they will necessitate too many powers of the external momenta.

So the most general current would look like
\[
	j^\mu = F_e \frac{p^\mu + p'^\mu}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger \Psi + F_m 	\frac{q_\nu}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger T^{\mu\nu} \Psi	
\]
In general the form factors might have quite complicated dependence on $q$, but these corrections will be too small compared to the type of result we're interested in.  At leading order $F_e$ will just be the electric charge of the particle in question, and $F_m$ will, as we'll see after connecting this result to the nonrelativistic limit, be related to the particle's $g$-factor.  So to the order we need, we can write the current as

%TODO check definition of form factors F_e and F_m
\[
	j^\mu =  e \frac{p^\mu + p'^\mu}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger \Psi +   e g \frac{q_\nu}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger T^{\mu\nu} \Psi
\]

%TODO Actually show this formally: that the two types of antisymmetric tensors aren't truly different
The tensor bilinear $\Psibar^\dagger T^{\mu\nu} \Psi$ itself has some free parameters.  However, it'll turn out that, when computing actual nonrelativistic amplitudes, the two types of anti-symmetric tensors collapse into the same general form.

This captures the essence of the interaction between a charged particle of general-spin and a single photon.


\subsection{Connection to nonrelativistic spinors}


In the rest frame, there are two independant bispinors which represent particle and antiparticle states: 
\[
	\Psi = \begin{pmatrix} \xi_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

or
\[
	\Psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \xi_0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

However, when we consider a particle with zero momentum it is not the case that the upper component of the bispinor can be directly associated with the Shrodinger like wave-function of the particle --- for instance, it would not be correctly normalized, for there is some mixing with the lower component.

We can obtain a relation between $\xi_0$ and the Shrodinger amplitude $\phi_s$ by considering the current density at zero momentum transfer.  For $\phi_s$ it will be $j_0 = e \phi_s^\dagger \phi$.  For the relativistic theory we have, as calculated above:
\[
	j^0 = e \frac{p^0 + p'^0}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger \Psi + F_m 	\frac{q_\nu}{2m} \Psibar^\dagger T^{0\nu} \Psi	
\]
At $q=0$ the expression simplifies

\[
	j^0(q=0) = e \frac{p_0}{m} \Psibar^\dagger \Psi
\]

\[
	= e  \frac{p_0}{m}( \phi^\dagger \phi - \chi^\dagger \chi )
\]

$\phi$ and $\chi$ are both related to the rest frame spinor $\xi_0$.  So we can write instead
\[
	j^0 = e \frac{p_0}{m} \xi_0^\dagger \left \{ 
		\cosh^2( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2})
		- \sinh^2( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2})
	\right \} \xi_0  
		=	e \frac{p_0}{m} \xi_0^\dagger \xi_0
\]
where the last equality follows from the hyperbolic trig identity.

If we demand that the two current densities be equal to each other, we find
\[
	\frac{p_0}{m} \xi_0^\dagger \xi_0 = \phi_s^\dagger \phi_s
\]
Approximating
\[
	\left( 1 + \frac{\v{p}^2}{2m} \right) \xi_0^\dagger \xi_0 = \phi_s^\dagger \phi_s
\]

This will hold to the necessary order if we identify
\[
	\xi_0 = \left( 1 - \frac{\v{p}^2}{4m} \right) \phi_s
\]

%TODO fix cosh expansion

To write the relativistic bispinors in terms of $\phi_s$ we will also need approximations to $\cosh( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2})$ and $\sinh( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2})$.  We only need the rapidity to the leading order: $\gv{\rapidity} \approx \v{v} \approx \frac{\v{p} }{m}$. 

\[
	\cosh( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2}) 
		\approx 1 + \left( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p} }{2m} \right)^2
\]
\[
	\sinh( \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \gv{\rapidity} }{2}) 
		\approx   \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p} }{2m}
\]

The the two bispinor components are
\beqa
\phi 
	&\approx&  \left(  1 + \left[ \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p} }{2m} \right]^2 \right) \xi_0 \\
	&\approx&  \left(  1 + \left[ \frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p} }{2m} \right]^2 - \frac{\v{p}^2}{4m} \right ) \phi_s	\\
 \chi
 	&\approx&	\frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p} }{2m} \xi_0 \\
 	&\approx&	\frac{\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p} }{2m} \phi_s
\eeqa



%TODO remember to hunt out all the \phi where I mean \rapidity
\subsection{Bilinears in terms of nonrelativistic theory}
The next step is to express the relativistic bilinears, built out of the bispinors $\Psi$, in terms of the Shrodinger like wave functions.

We have above written the bispinors in terms of $\phi_s$, so we can use those identities to express the bilinears in the same manner.

\beqa
\Psibar^\dagger(p') \Psi(p)
	&=&	\phi^\dagger \phi - \chi^\dagger \chi	\\
	&=&	\phi_s^\dagger \left[1 + \frac{(\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p'})^2 }{8m^2}  - \frac{\v{p'}^2}{4m^2} \right ]
			 \left[1 + \frac{(\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p})^2 }{8m^2}  - \frac{\v{p}^2}{4m^2} \right ] \phi_s
		- \phi_s^\dagger \left[
			\frac{ ( \gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p'}) (\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p}) }{4m^2}
		\right ] \phi_s	\\
	&=&	\phi_s^\dagger \left (
			1 - \frac{ \v{p}^2 + \v{p'}^2 }{4m^2}
			+ \frac{1}{8m^2} \left \{
				( \gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p'})^2 +  (\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p})^2 
				 - 2 ( \gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p'}) (\gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p})
			\right \}
	\right ) \phi_s	\\
	&=& \phi_s^\dagger \left (
			1 - \frac{ \v{p}^2 + \v{p'}^2 }{4m^2}
			+ \frac{1}{8m^2} \left \{
				[ \gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{p},  \gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{q}]  + ( \gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{q})^2 
			\right \}
	\right ) \phi_s	\\
	&=& \phi_s^\dagger \left (
			1 - \frac{ \v{p}^2 + \v{p'}^2 }{4m^2}
			+ \frac{1}{8m^2} \left \{
				[ 4 i \epsilon_{ijk} p_i q_j S_k  + ( \gv{\Sigma} \cdot \v{q})^2 
			\right \}
	\right ) \phi_s
\eeqa
%TODO at some point need to translate \Sigma functions into spin functions in NR theory, but where?




In calculating the nonrelativistic limit of the antisymmetric tensor bilinear, we will treat the $0i$ and the $ij$ components seperately.
