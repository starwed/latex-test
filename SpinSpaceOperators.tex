%TODO in the context of a field theory, is talking about the state-space the correct way of thinking about it?
In formulating NRQED for general spin particles, we need to consider all the possible operators might show up in the Lagrangian.  The state-space of a spin-$s$ particle is the direct product of it's spin-state and all the other state information.  We want to write down all possible operators which act only on the spin space.

For a particular representation, we can always write a bilinear as the spin operators and other operators acting between two spinors:
\beq
	\Psi^\dagger \mathcal{O}_S \mathcal{O}_X \Psi
\eeq

The two types of operators will always commute, since they act on orthogonal spaces, so it doesn't matter what order they're written in.  All such bilinears must be Galilean invariant, but individual operators might not be.  The non-spin operators we consider, such as $\v{D}$, $\v{B}$ or contractions with the tensor $\epsilon_{ijk}$ are already all written as 3-vectors or (in combination) as higher rank tensors.  Therefore, it will be most convenient to write spin-operators in the same way, so that writing Galilean-invariant combinations of the two types of operators is done just by contracting indices. 

The spinors $\Psi$ are written with $2s+1$ independent components.  The spin operators will be matrices acting on these components, and so for a spin-$s$ particle will be $(2s+1) \times (2s+1)$ matrices.  The combined operator $\mathcal{O}_S \mathcal{O}_X$ must be Hermitian, but without loss of generality we can require any $\mathcal{O}_S$, $\mathcal{O}_X$ to be Hermitian separately.  So there is the additional constraint that the matrices be Hermitian, and this means a total of $(2s+1)^2$ degrees of freedom.
%TODO: could include derivation of degrees of freedom?

For spin-$0$ there is only one component to the spinor, so the only possible matrix is equivalent to the identity.

For spin-$1/2$ we have, in addition to the identity matrix, the spin matrices $s_i = \frac{1}{2} \sigma_i$.  This is four independent matrices, and since the space has $(2s+1)^2 = 4$ degrees of freedom, exactly spans the space of all spin-operators.  If we try to construct terms which are bilinear in spin matrices, they just reduce through the identity $\sigma_i \sigma_j = \delta_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_k$, which we can already construct through combinations of the four operators we already have.  Since those four operators form a basis for the space, independent bilinears were forbidden even without an explicit form for the equation.


%TODO: Discuss/define operator ``order''
What about spin-$1$?  We need 9 independent operators to span the space.  All the operators that exist in spin-$1/2$ will work here as well, though the spin matrices will have a different representation.  That leaves 5 operators to construct.  It is natural to try to construct these from bilinear combinations of spin matrices.  Naively $S_i S_j$ would itself be 9 independent structures, but clearly some of these are expressible in terms of the lower order operators.

Regardless of their representation, the spin operators always fulfill certain identities based on their Lie group.  Namely
\beq
	S_i S_j \delta_{ij} \sim I, \; [S_i, S_j] = \epsilon_{ijk} S_k
\eeq
and it is these identities which allow certain combinations of $S_i S_j$ to be related to lower order operators.

If instead of general spin bilinears we consider only combinations which are
\begin{itemize}
  \item Symmetric in $i$, $j$ 
  \item Traceless
\end{itemize}
then such a structure will be independent of the set of operators $\{I, S_1, S_2, S_3\}$.  This is a set of 4 constraints, so from the original 9 degrees of freedom possessed by combinations of $S_i S_j$ are left only 5.  Together with the 4 lower order operators this is exactly enough to span the space.

We can explicitly write this symmetric, traceless structure as
\beq
	 S_i S_j + S_j S_i + \delta_{ij} S^2
\eeq

Finally consider the general spin case, proceeding inductively using the same rough idea as for the case of spin-$1$.  We construct all the possible operators from the set of all ``lower order'' operators which were used for lower spin particles, and by introducing new operators which are of higher degree in the spin matrices.

So suppose that for a spin-$s-1$ particle we have a set of operators written as $\bar{S}^0, \bar{S}^1, \ldots \bar{S}^{(s-1)}$, where a structure $\bar{S}^n$ carries $n$ Galilean indices and is symmetric and traceless between any pair of indices, that is:
\beq
	\bar{S}^n_{..i..j..} = \bar{S}^n_{..j..i..}, \; \delta_{ij} \bar{S}^n_{..i..j..}=0
\eeq 
(From above, $\bar{S}^0=I$, $\bar{S}^1_i = S_i$, and $\bar{S}^2 = S_i S_j + S_j S_i + \delta_{ij} S^2$.) 

The objects $\bar{S}^n$ are built as follows: start with all combinations involving the product of exactly $n$ spin matrices.  (There are $3^n$ such structures.)  Form them into combinations which are symmetric in all indices.  Each index has three possible values, so we can label each structure by how many indices are equal to 1 and 2.  If $a$ is the number of indices equal to $1$, and $b$ the number of indices equal to $2$, then for a given $a$ there are $n+1-a$ possible choices for $b$.  The total number of symmetric structures is then
\beq
	\Sigma^n_{a=0} (n-a+1) = \frac{1}{2} (n+1) (n+2)
\eeq
We have the additional constraint that the $\bar{S}^n$ be traceless in all indices.  This is an additional constrain for each pair of indices, and there are $n (n-1)/2$ pairs of indices.  The total degrees of freedom left are

\beq
	\frac{1}{2} (n+1) (n+2) - \frac{1}{2} n(n-1) 
		= \frac{1}{2}\left( n^2+3n +2 - n^2 +n\right )
		= 2n+1
\eeq

%TODO expand upon going from spin s particle to spin s-1
In combination with the lower order spin operators, this is exactly the number of independent operators we need to span the space.
